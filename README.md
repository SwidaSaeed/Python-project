## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates foundational **data analysis and visualisation skills in Python** using a Jupyter Notebook created in **Google Colab**.

The notebook focuses on:
- Loading and exploring CSV data
- Working with Pandas DataFrames
- Calculating descriptive statistics
- Visualising data using **histograms and boxplots**

The analysis is performed on a **student dataset**, with a focus on understanding the distribution of student scores.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **File:** `student.csv`  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Description:** Contains student-related data including numerical scores used for statistical analysis and visualisation.

---

## 🔍 Notebook Contents

### 📌 Data Handling
- Importing Python libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`)
- Loading CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Inspecting and exploring the dataset

### 📊 Descriptive Statistics
The notebook calculates:
- **Mean**
- **Median**
- **Mode**

These statistics are used to summarise student performance and identify central tendencies.

---

## 📈 Data Visualisation

### 📉 Histogram – Student Scores
- Shows the distribution of student scores
- Helps identify value ranges, frequency, and spread

### 📦 Boxplot – Student Scores
- Identifies potential outliers
- Displays quartiles and the median clearly

All visualisations are created using **Matplotlib**.
